# SDF05 Project

This is the readme file for the Blackjack game project. 

## Description

The purpose of the project was to create a fully functional Blackjack game folowing the instructions in the Scrimba course. 

## Design Choices and Functionality 

For the styling i used CSS to apply a  background image to the body, the appropriate font and color of the text. Then for the h1 element i added a custom color to the text, font style for the display image and lastly styling for the buttons. 

I used javascript to make the game functional, declaring the initial state of the game, a function to generate random cards if the player chooses another card, a function that renders the game by showing the appropriate message in accordance to the state of the game. 

## Features 

Overall i was quite pleased with the state of my game, it is fully functional. 

## Technologies Used 

*CSS for styling the buttons and Javascript for game functionality
